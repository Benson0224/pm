## Latest update of java-tron

- Sakary
  - Mainly there are two contents this time. One is the releasing of the Great Voyage 4.0.1. Weâ€™ve optimized the upgrade mechanism of java-Tron that 22 super representatives are required to upgrade to the new version instead of 27. I believe this will lead to more decentralized governance.
  The other is we launched the #40 voting request today for proposal 39. If proposal 39 comes to effect, zero-knowledge proof-verification functions will be supported in TVM, also, shielded TRC20 contract will be supported in TRON network. This will provide better privacy as users can hide their transaction amount, source and destination address.

## TIP62
- Xing 
  - Today I will give a speech about tron Consensus.
